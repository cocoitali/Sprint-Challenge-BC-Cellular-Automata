1. Describe the general process of how blocks are added to a blockchain.

Blockchain is a way to save data and make it immutable. To do this, every block gets a unique signature that corresponds exactly to the string of data in that block. If we had a block (1), then add a another one (2), the data in block 1 would be linked to block 2 by adding the signature of block 1 to the data of block 2. The signature of block 2 would be partially based on the signature of block 1, because it is included in the string of data in block 2. 

2. How can blockchain users mine coins? 

They can solve computational problems and chain together blocks of transactions with the correct hash, which in it, includes the hash of the previous block. To mine the coins, they have to make sure the transaction is accurate, in turn making the blockchain more secure.

First, they must verify 1 megabyte (MB) worth of transactions.

Second, in order to add a block of transactions to the blockchain, miners must solve a proof of work, which is the computational problem reffered to above.

3. Explain how simulations like Conway's Game of Life can be used in real-world applications.

Conway's Game of Life is considered a turing machine, and it's been helpful for scientists in understanding real life, by showing there are multiple ways of solving the same problem. Because of the cult following of these simulations, people are making meaningful contributions based on their interest alone.
